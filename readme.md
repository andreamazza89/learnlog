# Learn Log

This repo is to track what I am learning and what I have learned in the past.
The main reason for this is to keep me focused on what I am doing at one time and
also track how much time I spend doing what.

## Structure

There are just two files: this readme and `log.json`.
The readme contains a high-level overview of what I am currently learning/reading/doing.
The log consists of a list of entries, each entry including the what/when and a brief note.

### (Reading) - [Data and Reality](https://wiki.c2.com/?DataAndReality)
A nice book. Not at all practical; the overarching topic is that of showing/reflecting on the fact that
reality is almost impossible to model/record/grasp as data. So in order to have a workable system we must
understand that we are creating a limited model of reality so we can record it as data, where _context_ plays a fundamental role.

Topics include
- a description of how to describe 'one' thing in a system, as well as how to tell two things apart (sameness).
- naming, with scopes and qualifiers
- relationship. One thing I liked here is that he says he likes to describe them as the business 'reason' for the
relationship between two pieces of data.
- attributes - often we can describe the same thing as either an attribute or relationship, but we have a 'feel' for
which one applies where. One way to think of this is - what's the difference between a colum and a relationship?
  

#### What I learned
Not a ton. I do like the perspective of being more aware that reality is extremely complex/contradictory, but to
produce something useful we build a model/map of it, which narrows down the scope and makes it manageable by a computer.
To achieve this, context is very important, i.e. being deliberate about what the domain is.

I also like the idea of appreciating that technology poses limitations on how we can describe/process reality, so we must
start from the abstract model of the business needs/processes and then selecting the right technology + adapting to it.
