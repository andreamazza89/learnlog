# Learn Log

This repo is to track what I am learning and what I have learned in the past.
The main reason for this is to keep me focused on what I am doing at one time and
also track how much time I spend doing what.

## Structure

There are just two files: this readme and `log.json`.
The readme contains a high-level overview of what I am currently learning/reading/doing.
The log consists of a list of entries, each entry including the what/when and a brief note.
