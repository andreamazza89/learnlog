-- ideas for things to refactor/play with:

-- - create meaningful events that are 'parsed' from the state/raw event. something like FormEvent (exit) | FormEvent (type) | ListEvent (exit)
-- - some kind of abstraction to abstract how to draw a field, be it in view or edit mode
-- - would it be possible to rewrite handleFormEvent that just returns the new Form rather than the EventM?

-- things to do:

-- v add remaining fields for LogEntry
-- v highlight field red if in error
-- v new entry to be based on the one that was selected
-- v disable 'creating' or 'saving' an entry when the form is in error
-- - add tags (comma separated?)
-- - try abstract Form and List Widgets, so that if one day I rewrite my own then it'll be easier to migrate
-- - figure out a way to have a faster feedback loop (build/exec)
-- - try ad a popup ? like something around 'are you sure you wanna quit'?
